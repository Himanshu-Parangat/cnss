# Comprehensive Network Security Suite - Project Proposal ðŸŒ¸

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop a `hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System` (NIDS)
and `Intrusion Prevention System` (IPS) as part of an integrated network security suite.
The system will be implemented in Go (go-lang), leveraging its performance 
and concurrency features to create a fast high performance security solution.

## 2. Project Objectives

- Design and implement a comprehensive network security suite
- Create a modular and exteansible `Firewall` architecture for future enhancements
- Develop a hybrid NIDS/IPS system for real-time threat detection and prevention
- Utilize Go programming language to ensure high performance and concurrency
- Address real-world network security challenges, including DDoS attacks and various network threats

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Firewall
- Real-time network traffic monitoring
- Rule-based packet filtering
- IP address blocking
- Whitelist/Blacklist management
- DDoS attack detection and mitigation

### 3.2 Packet Analyzer
- Deep packet inspection
- TCP/UDP protocol analysis
- Signature-based threat detection (e.g., Nimda worm)
- HTTP request analysis

### 3.3 Logging and Alerting System
- Comprehensive event logging
- Integration with other components
- Real-time threat alerting

### 3.4 Testing Suite
- Traffic simulation for controlled testing
- Various attack scenario simulations
- Stress testing tools (e.g., packet flooding)

### 3.5 Network Scanner (as per need)
- Ping sweeper for network discovery
- Port scanning (SYN scan)
- Service fingerprinting
- Basic OS detection
- CSV export of scan results

### 3.6 Web Dashboard (Optional)
- Visual representation of network activities
- Display of key security metrics
- Real-time updates of network status

## 4. Key Features

- Modular architecture for easy expansion and maintenance
- High-performance packet processing using Go's concurrency features
- Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Optional web interface support for improved usability and data visualization

## 5. Project Relevance and Learning Outcomes

- Address real-world cybersecurity challenges, particularly in network threat detection and mitigation
- Gain practical experience in developing network security tools
- Enhance programming skills in Go, a modern and efficient language
- Deepen understanding of network protocols, security concepts.

## 6. Timeline and Milestones

[Expected be completed: ~4 to ~6 mounths]
